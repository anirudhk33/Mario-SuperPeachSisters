# Peach Party
### Overview
Peach Party is a two-player game closely resembling the [Mario Party](https://marioparty.nintendo.com/) series of action-based board games. Players control avatars, Peach and Yoshi, as they navigate through the squares on the game board, collecting coins and stars while avoiding enemies like Bowser and Boo. The goal is to gather the most stars and coins within 99 seconds of gameplay to become the ultimate winner. If a tie occurs, the winner is randomly selected. This was one of my class projects for CS 32 (Data Structures and Algorithms) at UCLA.

### Features
* The game features nine different boards of increasing complexity, with unique layouts and challenges. <br/> Below is an example of one of the boards. <br/> <br/>

* Players roll a virtual 10-sided die to determine how far they can move on the board during their turn.
* Players can choose direction of their movement at forks using direction keys.
* There are 10+ types of tiles to navigate, some of which boost performance while the rest hinder.
* In addition to tiles, enemies can perform clever tricks like magic teleportation and stealing coins from the players.
* Players can fire missiles to temporarily stun their enemies.
